# EDS214_Group4
Summer Session Group Project
Group Members : Heather, Kate, Fletcher, and Mariam 

Overall Goals:
Trying to compose a reproducible graph that others are able to compute
Replicating an existing graph by tidying, filtering, and calculating raw data 
Graphing change in different nutrient concentrations across different watersheds (Question 2)

Original plot we tried to copy (Question 1):

Why the project is useful

How users can get started with the project:

Make sure to open the Group_Fourk.qmd first, because it will contain the data needed. Make sure to check that the data used is readily available in the project. 

Question 2 :

How have other hurricanes affected nutrient concentrations (specifically Ca, Mg, SO2-4, TDN) from 2010 to 2018 in the PRM, BQ1,BQ2, BQ3 watersheds?

Resulting graphs:

Useful tips:
Make sure you and your group are all on the same page of how you would like to work on this project together (seperate branches or paired programming);
Make sure the nutrients you are measuring on the same graph are all the same units. 
Try to be as familiar as you can be with Github, (ie cloning repositories)
