      <description>Look for entity size element as a prep for checking congruence, and if not present, generate a warn. Note that to be most useful (i.e, to check congruence), entity size should contain the most precise measure of size, which is "byte" (the default unit); however, the presence or name of the entity size unit is NOT checked.</description>

      <explanation>Examining the entity size is prep for checking congruence. Including the element is best practice, and if not present, a warn is generated. To be most useful, entity size should contain the most precise measure of size, which is "byte" (the default unit).</explanation>

      <description>Look for entity size element as a prep for checking congruence, and if not present, generate a warn.

      <explanation>Examining the entity size is prep for checking congruence. Including the element is best practice, and if not present, a warn is generated. To be most useful, entity size should contain the most precise measure of size, which is "byte" (the default unit).</explanation>

      <explanation>PASTA will use this value to check the integrity of the data it downloads from your site. In addition, PASTA is planning to compare the contributor-supplied checksum/hash value documented 
      in the physical/authentication element to the checksum/hash value of this entity downloaded from previous revisions of this data package. If PASTA already has a copy of this entity, it will be able 
      to avoid an unnecessary download of the entity from your site, resulting in faster processing of the new data package revision when you update it in PASTA.</explanation>

      to avoid an unnecessary download of the entity from your site, resulting in faster processing of the new data package revision when you update it in PASTA.</explanation>

      in the physical/authentication element to the checksum/hash value of this entity downloaded from previous revisions of this data package. If PASTA already has a copy of this entity, it will be able 
      to avoid an unnecessary download of the entity from your site, resulting in faster processing of the new data package revision when you update it in PASTA.</explanation>

      <description>Look for entity size element as a prep for checking congruence, and if not present, generate a warn.

      <description>Look for entity size element as a prep for checking congruence, and if not present, generate a warn.

      <explanation>Examining the entity size is prep for checking congruence. Including the element is best practice, and if not present, a warn is generated. To be most useful, entity size should contain the most precise measure of size, which is "byte" (the default unit).</explanation>

      to avoid an unnecessary download of the entity from your site, resulting in faster processing of the new data package revision when you update it in PASTA.</explanation>

      in the physical/authentication element to the checksum/hash value of this entity downloaded from previous revisions of this data package. If PASTA already has a copy of this entity, it will be able 
      to avoid an unnecessary download of the entity from your site, resulting in faster processing of the new data package revision when you update it in PASTA.</explanation>

      <description>Look for entity size element as a prep for checking congruence, and if not present, generate a warn.

      <explanation>Examining the entity size is prep for checking congruence. Including the element is best practice, and if not present, a warn is generated. To be most useful, entity size should contain the most precise measure of size, which is "byte" (the default unit).</explanation>

      in the physical/authentication element to the checksum/hash value of this entity downloaded from previous revisions of this data package. If PASTA already has a copy of this entity, it will be able 
      to avoid an unnecessary download of the entity from your site, resulting in faster processing of the new data package revision when you update it in PASTA.</explanation>
